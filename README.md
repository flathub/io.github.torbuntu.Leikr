#### Why Groovy?

>Groovy: If you describe something as groovy, you mean that it is **attractive, fashionable, or exciting.**  https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/groovy

>Apache Groovy is a **powerful, optionally typed** and **dynamic** language, with **static-typing** and **static compilation** capabilities, for the Java platform aimed at improving developer productivity thanks to a concise, familiar and **easy to learn syntax**.
